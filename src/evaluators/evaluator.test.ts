Your trusty sword by your side, you stand before the crypt's entrance, its ominous darkness promising danger and perhaps, answers.\n\nYou: I kick in the dooâ€¦u step inside, you can hear the scurrying of small creatures, disturbed by your intrusion. \n\nYou: I skewer one of the small creatures with my sword\nDM:  The creature squeals in pain and dies instantly. You notice that it has a long tail and sharp claws, indicating that it was likely some kind of rodent or insectivore. As you continue deeper into the cave, the air becomes cooler and damper, and the walls are covered in moss and lichen. Suddenly, you hear a low growl from somewhere ahead of you.`;
